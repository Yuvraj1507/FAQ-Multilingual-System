FAQ Multilingual System 


This project is a multilingual FAQ system built with Django and Django REST Framework. 
It allows users to manage Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in multiple languages 
(English, Hindi, Bengali). The system supports rich-text answers via the WYSIWYG editor
(django-ckeditor) and caches translated questions using Redis for improved performance.


## Features
- Multi-language FAQ management (English, Hindi, Bengali)
- WYSIWYG editor for rich-text answers
- Dynamic translation using Google Translate
- Fast and efficient API with caching

## Model Design

The system utilizes a Django model to store FAQs with the following fields:
- **Question:** A `TextField` to store the FAQ question.
- **Answer:** A `RichTextField` for rich-text formatting of the FAQ answer, utilizing the django-ckeditor.
- **Language-Specific Translations:** Fields for translations, such as `question_hi` for Hindi and `question_bn` for Bengali.

A method is implemented to retrieve translated text dynamically based on the selected language.

## WYSIWYG Editor Integration

The project integrates the `django-ckeditor` library to allow users to format answers properly. The WYSIWYG editor supports multilingual content to enhance the user experience.

## API Development

A Django REST API is created to manage FAQs with the following features:
- Support for language selection via the `?lang=` query parameter.
- Efficient responses leveraging pre-translation to enhance performance.




## Caching Mechanism

The Django caching framework is implemented to store translations efficiently. Redis is utilized for improved performance, ensuring quick access to frequently requested data.

## Multi-language Translation Support

The project uses the Google Translate API (or `googletrans` library) to automate translations during object creation. In cases where a translation is unavailable, a fallback to English is provided.



## Django Admin Panel

The FAQ model is registered in the Django Admin panel, providing a user-friendly interface for managing FAQs, enabling easy addition, editing, and deletion of FAQs.

## Unit Tests & Code Quality

Unit tests are written using `pytest` or Djangoâ€™s built-in unittest framework. Tests cover model methods and API responses to ensure functionality. The project adheres to PEP8 guidelines, utilizing `flake8` for linting.


## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:


1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuvraj1507/faq-multilingual-system.git
   cd faq_project


# Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


# Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


~ Set up Redis on my local machine or use Docker to run it. (Followed Redis installation for local setup)


# Run migrations to set up the database:
python manage.py migrate

# Run the development server:
python manage.py runserver

The app should be accessible at http://localhost:8000/.

~ (Optional) To test the app, you can also use Postman or curl commands to interact with the API. 
I Used Postman to Interact with the API.

API Usage:


Fetch FAQs in English (default):
http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/


Fetch FAQs in Hindi:
http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=hi


Fetch FAQs in Bengali:
http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/?lang=bn


~ Create a new FAQ (POST request):
-X POST http://localhost:8000/api/faqs/ -d '{"question": "What is Django?", "answer": "Django is a high-level Python web framework."}' 

The new FAQ will automatically be translated into Hindi and Bengali during creation.
